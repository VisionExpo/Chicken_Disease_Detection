            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering images of poultry for disease detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing Pipeline:</strong> Cleaning and augmenting the dataset for training, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Using a pre-trained VGG16 model with transfer learning to detect poultry diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment Pipeline:</strong> Once the model is trained, it is deployed for inference, making it accessible to users in real-time.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dataset:</strong> Consists of images of poultry, labeled for various diseases (e.g., Newcastle Disease, Infectious Bronchitis, etc.). The dataset is augmented using techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve model robustness.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> We use VGG16 as the base model, with the initial layers frozen. New fully connected layers are added to adapt the model for poultry disease detection. The model includes dropout and batch normalization layers for better generalization.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Process:</strong> The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and an Adam optimizer. Early stopping is used to prevent overfitting, and training is done in batches to improve efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> The trained model is packaged and deployed using a Flask application that exposes a REST API for real-time predictions.</li>

    <!-- VGG16 & Pre-trained Model Architecture -->
    <section>
        <h3>VGG16 Model and Pre-trained Architecture:</h3>
        <p>
            The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) consisting of 16 weight layers (13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers). It was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we leverage the pre-trained VGG16 model as a feature extractor. The lower layers of the model are frozen, retaining their ability to extract important features, while the upper layers are replaced with a new classification head tailored for poultry disease detection.

    <!-- Transfer Learning Approach -->
    <section>
        <h3>Transfer Learning Approach:</h3>
        <p>
            **What is Transfer Learning?**  
            Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, originally trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet), is fine-tuned for a different but related task. Instead of training from scratch, we reuse learned features, which accelerates training and improves performance, especially with limited labeled data.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Why is Transfer Learning Beneficial?**
            <ul>
                <li>**Faster Training**: Instead of learning features from scratch, the model only fine-tunes high-level layers, significantly reducing training time.</li>
                <li>**Better Performance with Limited Data**: Since the pre-trained model has already learned general features (edges, shapes, textures), it performs well even with fewer training images.</li>
                <li>**Avoids Overfitting**: Using a pre-trained model prevents overfitting, especially in domains with limited labeled data.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            **How We Used Transfer Learning in This Project**  
            In this project, the VGG16 model is used as a feature extractor. The initial convolutional layers are frozen, meaning their weights are not updated during training. A new classifier is added on top of VGG16, trained specifically for poultry disease classification. Only the newly added layers are updated during training.
